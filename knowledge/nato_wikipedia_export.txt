NATO PA interacts directly with the parliamentary structures of the national governments of the member states which appoint Permanent Members, or ambassadors to NATO. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly is made up of legislators from the member countries of the North Atlantic Alliance as well as thirteen associate members. It is however officially a structure different from NATO, and has as aim to join deputies of NATO countries in order to discuss security policies on the NATO Council.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} ===Legal authority of NATO commanders=== NATO is an alliance of 31 sovereign states and their individual sovereignty is unaffected by participation in the alliance. NATO has no parliaments, no laws, no enforcement, and no power to punish individual citizens. As a consequence of this lack of sovereignty the power and authority of a NATO commander are limited. NATO commanders cannot punish offences such as failure to obey a lawful order; dereliction of duty; or disrespect to a senior officer.<ref name="terla">{{cite journal |last1=Randall |first1=Thomas E. |title=Legal Authority of NATO Commanders |journal=NATO Legal Gazette |date=July 2014 |issue=34 |pages=39–45 |url=https://www.act.nato.int/application/files/1016/0999/3864/legal_gazette_34.pdf |access-date=29 August 2021 |archive-date=29 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210829212244/https://www.act.nato.int/application/files/1016/0999/3864/legal_gazette_34.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> NATO commanders expect obeisance but sometimes need to subordinate their desires or plans to the operators who are themselves subject to sovereign codes of conduct like the [[UCMJ]].

The joint rules of engagement must be followed, and the [[Law of Armed Conflict]] must be obeyed at all times. Operational resources "remain under national command but have been transferred temporarily to NATO. Although these national units, through the formal process of transfer of authority, have been placed under the operational command and control of a NATO commander, they never lose their national character." Senior national representatives, like [[Chief of the Defence Staff (disambiguation)|CDS]], "are designated as so-called red-cardholders".
